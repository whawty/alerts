NAME
----

whawty-alerts - the simple alert manager


SYNOPSIS
--------

*whawty-alerts*  '[global options]' *<command>* '[command options]' '[arguments ... ]'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*whawty-alerts* is a simple daemon that handles notifications for monitoring alerts from
the Prometheus Alertmanager. Notifications can be sent via eMail as well as SMS. Unless
most other solutions whawty.alerts tries to be of use without access to the internet.
This means sending eMails and SMS is not done using the API of some cloud provider but
rather using local resources such as GSM modems connected via USB.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------

The following global options can be passed to *whawty-alerts*.

*-h | --help*::
    Show help text and exit.

*-v | --version*::
    Print version information and exit.


COMMANDS
--------

Any of the following commands supports *-h | --help* as an option. This will print
extra help information for the command. All these commands use the auth store directory
as specified by the global store configuration file.

run '[options]'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...tbd...

runsa
~~~~~

This is basically the same as *run* but expects all sockets to be passed via systemd
socket activation. *whawty-alerts* will run the web-api on all TCP sockets. All other
socket types are ignored.


SIGNALS
-------

On HUP *whawty-alerts* tries to reload the configuration. I also runs a basic
consistency check. If there is any error during that process the old configuration
will be kept.


BUGS
----

Most likely there are some bugs in *whawty-alerts*. If you find a bug, please let
the developers know at http://github.com/whawty/alerts. Of course, pull requests
are preferred.
